# Exploring the Relationship Between the Rating of Recipes and the Number of Ingredients and the Number of Steps

# Introduction: <br>
This project will explore whether or not the number of ingredients and the number of steps in a recipe affect its rating. The key question that is being asked here is: *How does the number of ingredients and the number of steps in a recipe affect its rating?* This question is important, especially for people who love cooking and trying to design a new recipe, as such a relationship provides a helpful insight into how complexity influences satisfaction. For example, If fewer ingredients correlate to a relatively high rating, the recipe designer might focus more on simplicity. On the other hand, if more ingredients correlate to a relatively high rating, designing complex recipes may be worth the effort.
